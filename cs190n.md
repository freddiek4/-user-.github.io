# CS 190N: Machine Learning for Networking 

This course is taught by Professor [Arpit Gupta](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~arpitgupta/) - who has published extensively in Networking, Analytics, and Security [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=lc3R9-wAAAAJ).

I also received guidence on my personal networking project by PhDs [Sylee Beltiukov](https://maybe-hello-world.github.io) and [Satyandra Guthula](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyandra-guthula-59b25363/), [Esha Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/esha-gupta01/), [Laasya Koduru](https://lmkoduru.github.io).



The UCSB campus contains around 80+ Raspberry Pi 4 devices controlled by [SaltStack](https://github.com/saltstack/salt) which use UCSB wifi infrastructure and are sometimes used to mimic real-users <- applicable for research testing:
