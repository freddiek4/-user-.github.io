## About Me
I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara studying Statistics & Data Science and Applied Mathematics.

2025: I have started working in the NIH funded [Bionic Vision](https://bionicvisionlab.org) Laboratory under the Computer Science Department at UCSB. My work is under [Dr. Schneider](https://schneidermarius.github.io) and [Yuchen Hou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuchen-hou-b95083205/). My work will include applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
