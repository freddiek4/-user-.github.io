I attended Elizabeth Von Thadden Gymnasium, a faith based school focusing on science and ethics, in Heidelberg, Germany.

In 2016, I moved to Palo Alto, California attending J.L. Stanford Middle School. I learned english and quickly became interested in
programming through my 6th grade Web Programming course. 

Then, from 2018 to 2022, I studied at Palo Alto High School where I mainly focused on Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science. 
I attended Foothill Community College through dual-enrollment and learned object-oriented programming. 

From 2022 to 2024, I studied at the University of California, Davis studying Data Science and Mathematics. Additionally, I worked in
the Cognitive Intelligence Laboratory under Dr. Seth Frey, as well as the Language Learning Laboratory under Davis's Center for Mind and
Brain. 

In 2023, I spent my summmer at UC Berkeley studying Software Engineering and Linear Algebra. After finishing my courses in July, I headed
down to the University of California, Los Angeles where I continued my summer studies in Statistics and Linguistics. My final report paper
can be read here: [Final Paper-4.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18091046/Final.Paper-4.pdf) - which was reviewed by 
[Kevin Schäfer](https://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/people/kevin-schäfer) PhD at UCSB. 

In 2024, I transferred to UC Santa Barbara, and continued my studies in Statistics & Data Science and Mathematics.
