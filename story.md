I attended [Elizabeth Von Thadden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_von_Thadden) Gymnasium, a faith based school focusing on science and ethics, in Heidelberg, Germany.

In 2016, I moved to Palo Alto, California attending J.L. Stanford Middle School. I learned English and quickly became interested in programming through my 6th grade Web Programming course. 

Then, from 2018 to 2022, I studied at Palo Alto High School where I mainly focused on Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science. I attended Foothill Community College through dual-enrollment and learned object-oriented programming.

From 2022 to 2024, I studied at the University of California, Davis studying Data Science and Mathematics. Additionally, I worked in the Cognitive Intelligence Laboratory under [Dr. Seth Frey](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/directory/seth-frey), as well as the Language Learning Laboratory under [Davis's Center for Mind and Brain](https://mindbrain.ucdavis.edu/about). 

In 2023, I spent the summmer at UC Berkeley studying Software Engineering and Linear Algebra. After finishing my courses in July, I headed down to the University of California, Los Angeles where I continued my summer studies in Statistics and Linguistics. My Linguistics research paper
can be read here: [Final Paper on Loanword adaptation of Muslim Chinese words into Turfan Uyghur based on data from PhD disseration Yakup (2005)](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18091046/Final.Paper-4.pdf) - which was reviewed by [Kevin Schäfer](https://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/people/kevin-schäfer) PhD at UCSB. 

In 2024, I transferred to UC Santa Barbara, where I am currently continuing studies in Statistics & Data Science and Mathematics.
